            <p>The Oramind Platform is a platform developed for R&D purposes, by Oramind. It is the backend system for iGreekNews, a revitalized application, aimed at bringing the latest Greek News in a smooth and fast manner to handheld devices. <a href="http://oramind.net">oramind.net</a> and <a href="http://oramind.com">oramind.com</a> are both sustained and developed by the same legal entity.</p>

            <p>iGreekNews was released at the end of 2008 for the iPhone, and it was the first premium RSS reader in Greece that was functioning the way it did. It featured asynchronous background download, a fluid UI, a database for favorite URLs and articles, and a big list of the most known news sources in Greece. In later versions, support for viewing the Greek Newspaper covers was added. in 2010, iGreekNews HD was released, which was a complete rewrite of the original, developed exclusively for the iPad. iGreekNews stayed to the top of the Greek App Store for 3 months, and another 1 month after the feature with the newspaper covers was added. It was the most fully featured Greek news application that existed, and it still remains actively used, even after so many years.</p>

            <p>On April 29, 2014, iGreekNews was taken down, as it was hard to keep up with updating the application without writing it from scratch.</p>

            <p>Now, iGreekNews has been written from scratch, using the Oramind Platform as its backend, and it is a showcase of the data collected by the platform, and its API handling.</p>

            <p>The oramind API supports news categorization, facilities like extracting the content from a web page (stripping useless information), and article association in the form of "similar" articles.</p> It implements smart caching to avoid server load. News streaming will be implemented, too.
